                            <em><span style="color: red;">Learn with Me</span></em> is a collection of structured
                            guides on resources that I've used to learn some of my favorite topics. For example, the
                            the <em>Deep Learnin Book</em> by Ian Goodfellow et.al has been a <em>godsend</em> for 
                            learning, in-depth, the mathematical foundations of neural networks. However, it's a bit
                            dense for people who aren't exceptional at undergrad-level math.

                            <!-- (1) I don't like the way this paragraph starts; try something that a little less ambiguous -->
                            <!-- (2) This is vague, but I know it's because I got lazy lol. Going to work on that later. -->
                            [To remedy this (1)] I decided to keep a detailed set of notes that explains each concept in
                            more simple terms. This means the study guide is a little more verbose, but it definitely
                            helps when you find yourself stuck on a particular example. I've also made it possible
                            to suggest edits to the page, and [other things as well(2)].
