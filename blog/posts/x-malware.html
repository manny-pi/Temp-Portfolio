						<p>
							Depending on your background, the term <b>user</b> might evoke images
							that could be ranked on a scale of <em>seek help</em> to
							<em>I'm a user too!</em>. I truly hope you're on the latter end of this
							spectrum. In any case, I'll define the term <b>user</b>
							as an individual that uses software to accomplish a task. [connect to
							next paragraph]
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Malware</b> is "malicious software." It is a program designed not to
							help a user, but to <span style="color: red">destroy them</span>. That's
							an exaggeration, but the connotation remains the same.
						</p>
						<p>
							To improve my understanding of the concept of malware, and yours -
							<em>the community</em> - I decided to research the topic extensively, and
							share with you the things I learned. As always, I'll provide links to my
							sources, and I'll leave sections of the document open for suggestions for
							improvement.
