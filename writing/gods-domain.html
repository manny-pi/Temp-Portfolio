                        I'm a 22 year old Nigerian living on [Heaven's Edge], and this is the story of how I died.

                        My father, [Zayn], is a [independant] pilot, and my mother, Dimitra, is a Software Engineer for the
                        [Mathias Foundation] in [New Landing]. Heaven, as the residents call it, is one of the last known 
                        [material planes] inhabited by [meta-humans]. Most of the other [colonies] have been abandoned
                        since the [3rd virus] wiped out 70% of the Network's population, but none of this mattered to 
                        Heaven's inhabitant for all things faded into the peripharies of their drug-induced reverie, 
                        including the rotting corpses that decorated vast expanses of the cityscape.

                        The meta-human phenomenon started when the Mathias Foundation started commerically distributing

                        is considered a litter of sick bastard's that refuse
                        to accept mortality; descecrators that choose to refute the powers that be, forcefully prolonged
                        their lives using the abominations borne of their ingenious. But, this couldn't be further from the
                        truth. Or rather, it isn't all of it...

                    The 17th year of annihilation was historically pitiful. Men, women, and children flayed each other 
                    on the streets in exuberant displays their commitment their Union. Unions were networks of colonies 
                    that survivded ... The Edge was full of them. Deadbeats and millionaires on the fringes of insanity, 
                    forced to satiate their sick lust for butchery with artificial suicide. The bodies they mutilated 
                    were off-the-shelf.
