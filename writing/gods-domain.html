            <h2>[section]</h2>
            <div>
                My name is Domain. I'm a year old 22 Nigerian male, currently residing on Heaven's Edge - The Edge.
                My father, Zayn, was an independant pilot, and my mother, Dimitra, is a software developer for the Mathias Cooperation in New Landing.
                The Edge is one of the last known material planes inhabited by meta-humans. Most of the other colonies have been abandoned 
                for fear of war.
                
                To most of humanity, the meta-human population is considered a litter of sick bastard's that refuse to accept mortality; descecrators that choose to 
                refute the powers that be, forcefully prolonged their lives using the abominations borne of their ingenious. But, this couldn't be further from the truth. 
                Or rather, it isn't all of it...

                The 17th year of annihilation was historically pitiful. Men, women, and children flayed each other on the streets in exuberant displays
                their commitment their Union. Unions were networks of colonies that survivded ... The Edge was full of them. Deadbeats and millionaires on the fringes 
                of insanity, forced to satiate their sick lust for butchery with artificial suicide. The bodies they mutilated were off-the-shelf
